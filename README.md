Havoc is a physical action game for 2 or more players.  Players choose between 3 weapons and fight to the death.  Last knight standing is the winner!

#### SETUP
Distribute 1 Havoc Blink to each player, representing that player's "Knight".  Havoc tiles start in the "Forge" state, indicated by a flickering fire animation.  Here, players can press the button to cycle between 3 weapons: sword, axe, and chakram.  Players select a weapon for their knight by double clicking, indicating that they are ready for battle.

### GAMEPLAY
When all players have selected their weapons, players place their tiles on a table, resting at least one finger on top to allow movement.  Players then begin the game by counting down and yelling ***"CHARGE!"*** (or a battlecry of their choosing).

Players move their blink around on the table, trying to stab/slash/cleave the other players blinks.  If a "blade" face makes contact with another blinks "empty" face, the receiving blink takes damage.  When a blink recieves 3 hits, it is pronounced "dead" (indicated by turning totally red) and that player is knocked out of the round.

### WIN CONDITION
The winner of the round is the last player to keep their knight alive.
